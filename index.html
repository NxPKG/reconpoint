<h3>Quick Installation</h3>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Only Ubuntu/VPS</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Clone this repo</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git clone https://github.com/khulnasoft/reconpoint &amp;&amp; cd reconpoint
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Edit the dotenv file, <strong>please make sure to change the password for postgresql <code>POSTGRES_PASSWORD</code>!</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nano .env
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>In the dotenv file, you may also modify the Scaling Configurations</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">MAX_CONCURRENCY=80
MIN_CONCURRENCY=10
</code></pre>
<p> MAX_CONCURRENCY: This parameter specifies the maximum number of reconPoint&#39;s concurrent Celery worker processes that can be spawned. In this case, it&#39;s set to 80, meaning that the application can utilize up to 80 concurrent worker processes to execute tasks concurrently. This is useful for handling a high volume of scans or when you want to scale up processing power during periods of high demand. If you have more CPU cores, you will need to increase this for maximised performance.</p>
<p> MIN_CONCURRENCY: On the other hand, MIN_CONCURRENCY specifies the minimum number of concurrent worker processes that should be maintained, even during periods of lower demand. In this example, it&#39;s set to 10, which means that even when there are fewer tasks to process, at least 10 worker processes will be kept running. This helps ensure that the application can respond promptly to incoming tasks without the overhead of repeatedly starting and stopping worker processes.</p>
<p> These settings allow for dynamic scaling of Celery workers, ensuring that the application efficiently manages its workload by adjusting the number of concurrent workers based on the workload&#39;s size and complexity</p>
</li>
<li><p>Run the installation script, Please keep an eye for any prompt, you will also be asked for username and password for reconPoint.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo ./install.sh
</code></pre>

<h3>First-time Open Source contributors</h3>
<p>Please note that reconPoint is beginner friendly. If you have never done open-source before, we encourage you to do so. <strong>We will be happy and proud of your first PR ever.</strong></p>
<p>You can start by resolving any <a href="https://github.com/khulnasoft/reconpoint/issues">open issues</a>.</p>
<h3>Support and Sponsoring</h3>
<p>Over the past few years, I have been working hard on reconPoint to add new features with the sole aim of making it the de facto standard for reconnaissance. I spend most of my free time and weekends working on reconPoint. I do this in addition to my day job. I am happy to have received such overwhelming support from the community. But to keep this project alive, I am looking for financial support.</p>

<p>It takes a considerable amount of time to add new features and make sure everything works. Donating is your way of saying: <strong>reconPoint is awesome</strong>.</p>
<p>Any support is greatly appreciated! Thank you!</p>
<h3>reconPoint Bug Bounty Program</h3>
<p><a href="https://huntr.dev/bounties/disclose/?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fkhulnasoft%2Freconpoint"><img src="https://cdn.huntr.dev/huntr_security_badge_mono.svg" alt="huntr"></a></p>
<p>Security researchers, welcome aboard! I&#39;m excited to announce the reconPoint bug bounty programme in collaboration with <a href="https://huntr.dev">huntr.dev</a>, which means that you will be rewarded for any vulnerabilities you find in reconPoint.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in reporting reconPoint vulnerabilities!
